hey, I'm @JoevEVan but you can just call me Evan.
I'm interested in programming, galactic science and everything related to science.
I am a shy person and introvert so I can write a lot less than others. (mainly I do not trust others on the Internet) I'm just starting my adventure with programmingso 
I will be grateful if you advise me something :)
my pronouns are she/her
